# Snake-Game
The game is the usual snake game. A basic idea behind the game is that the snake looks for food to eat. As it eats more food, it grows in length. As the snakes body becomes larger and larger, the space to work with becomes small, forcing the snake to eventually bite itself and dies. As soon as it dies then game over.
